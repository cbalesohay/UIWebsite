            <p>The Center for Intelligent Industrial Robotics owns two open-source Farmbots. These devices, which automatically plant and water, are being used in conjunction with PLCs and a custom lighting gantry to extend their operation indoors and link common industrial controls with precision agriculture. The FarmBot has been a great undergraduate project for independent research as well as class research projects. FarmBot projects have been supported by the Office of Undergraduate Research.</p>
